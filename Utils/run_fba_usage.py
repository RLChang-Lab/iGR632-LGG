     """
    Runs FBA simulation on a cobra model object for maximization of specified objective function 

    Args:
        model (Cobra model): CB model to run simulation on 
        objective (str): desired objective function for simulation. Default is iGR632 LGG model biomass function 'curated_biomass', but could be any model rxn  
    Returns: 
        result (cobra.core.solution.Solution): Cobrapy solution object 
    Notes:
        - Model is constrained previously (example, set_dm must be run first to simulate DM condition)
        - KeyError if objective reaction input does not exist in model 
        - Solution object contains: 
            fluxes (pandas.core.series.Series)

            objective value (float)

            reduced costs (pandas.core.series.Series)
